# Python Lexer and Parser

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **lexer and parser** using **Python Lex-Yacc (PLY)** to recognize fundamental Python constructs. The constructs identified by the parser include:
- **Lambda Function Definitions**
- **Dictionary Declarations**
- **List Comprehensions**
- **Exception Handling (try-except)**
- **Generator Functions with `yield`**

## ✨ Features
- **Tokenizes and parses** Python code constructs.
- Implements **error handling** for invalid syntax.
- Provides **test cases** to validate functionality.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** – The primary programming language.
- **PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)** – Used for lexing and parsing.

## 📦 Installation
To run the project, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install ply
```
